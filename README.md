## To-do-list ##

The project's goal is to learn how to use webpack. "To-do list" is a tool that helps to organize your day. It simply lists the things that you need to do and allows you to mark them as complete. You will build a simple website that allows for doing that, and you will do it using ES6 and Webpack!

Built With

- HTML, CSS, JS, ES6
- Linters, Node.js, Git, Flexbox, Webpack

[Portolio Live Demo](https://mateo951.github.io/to-do-list/)

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

- On your terminal and run the following command to clone the repository

#### To test the app locally, use Live Server (Extension for VS Code) to avoid js module CORS policy ####
